            camera (Camera): Camera Class object that has the camera intrinsics and functions to get the current RGB image frame.
            n_data (int): Number of calibration tag and robot end-effector pose pairs to be collected for calibration.
            calib_data_file_name (str): Path to the text file where robot end-effector and calibration tag's pose are written to. 
            output_file (str): Path to the YAML file to which the robot camera calibration results are stored in
